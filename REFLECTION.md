# Reflection: StaticSavvy Loan Management Dashboard

## Project Overview
StaticSavvy is a modern, single-page React application for managing customer loans. It features a clean dashboard, customer management, and persistent data storage using localStorage. The app is designed for ease of use, visual appeal, and extensibility.

## Technical Decisions
- **React 19 & TypeScript:** Chosen for type safety, maintainability, and modern React features (hooks, strict mode).
- **Vite:** Used for fast development and build times.
- **TailwindCSS:** Enables rapid, consistent, and responsive UI development.
- **Component Structure:** The app is split into clear, reusable components (Dashboard, LoanForm, CustomerTable, CustomerModal, Header).
- **Custom Hook (`useCustomers`):** Encapsulates customer state, filtering, and localStorage logic for separation of concerns.
- **Type Definitions:** All customer data is strongly typed for reliability and future scalability.

## Design Choices
- **UI/UX:** Focused on clarity, accessibility, and a modern look using gradients, icons, and responsive layouts.
- **Data Persistence:** Used localStorage for simplicity and offline capability. No backend required for demo/testing.
- **Extensibility:** The codebase is structured for easy addition of features (e.g., backend integration, authentication, analytics).

## Challenges
- **Type Handling:** Ensuring all form and storage data is correctly typed and parsed, especially when converting between strings and numbers.
- **LocalStorage Sync:** Managing updates and ensuring data consistency across reloads.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Balancing rich visuals with performance and accessibility.

## Future Improvements
- **Backend Integration:** Add API support for multi-user, cloud-based data.
- **Authentication:** User login and role-based access.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for components and hooks.
- **CI/CD:** Set up automated testing and deployment workflows.
- **Accessibility:** Further improve ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
- **Internationalization:** Support multiple languages and currencies.
